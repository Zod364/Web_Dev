        "1.  **Django Models:** If you want to store and manage nutrition tips, activities, or FAQs in a database, you'd define models in `nutrition_app/models.py`. Then you'd use Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) in your views to fetch this data and pass it to your templates.\n",
        "2.  **Django Admin:** After creating models, you can register them in `nutrition_app/admin.py` to get a powerful, auto-generated admin interface for managing your site's content.\n",
        "3.  **Forms:** For more complex user input (e.g., a contact form or a more detailed query form for the bot), you'd use Django Forms.\n",
        "4.  **More Advanced Bot:**\n",
        "      * **Server-Side Logic:** Move the bot's response logic from JavaScript to a Python function in `views.py` (like the commented-out `bot_query_view` example). The JavaScript would then use `Workspace()` to send the user's query to this Django view and display the response. This allows for more complex Python logic.\n",
        "      * **NLP Libraries:** For a smarter bot, explore Python libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or even integrate with AI chatbot platforms.\n",
        "5.  **Styling:** Learn more CSS to make your website visually more appealing.\n",
        "6.  **Deployment:** Once your site is ready, you'll want to deploy it to a web server so others can access it (e.g., using Heroku, PythonAnywhere, AWS, Google Cloud).\n",
        "7.  **User Authentication:** If you want users to log in, Django has a robust built-in authentication system.\n",
